# Battery-Timer
## A Foundation Model for Battery Discharge Capacity Degradation Forecasting

![image](https://github.com/sjtu-chan-joey/Battery-Timer/blob/main/Figures/lora.png)

Battery-Timer is a domain-adapted time series foundation model tailored for lithium-ion battery capacity degradation prediction. Built upon the Transformer-based Timer architecture developed by Tsinghua University, Battery-Timer is fine-tuned using approximately 10GB of publicly available battery degradation datasets to encourage a degradation-aware representation learning. This enables the model to generalize well across varying battery chemistries, operational scenarios, and degradation profiles. Extensive validation on the in-house CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that Battery-Timer not only surpasses the performance of its untuned counterpart but also exhibits strong zero-shot learning (ZSL) capabilities across both constant current (CC) and constant current-constant voltage (CCCV) charging conditions. Despite its large parameter size, Battery-Timer serves as a powerful teacher model in the proposed knowledge distillation framework, significantly improving the generalization ability of lightweight expert models while preserving low computational costs.

üîÅ Test Cycle Procedure

Each battery cell undergoes repeated degradation cycles until its capacity falls below 80% of its rated capacity. The cycle is as follows:

1. Discharge the cell completely.
2. Repeat:
    - **CC profile**: Charge at 1C (13A) until voltage reaches **3.9V**.
    - **CCCV profile**: Charge at 1C (13A) to **3.65V**, then hold at 3.65V until current drops below **0.65A (0.05C)**.
    - Rest for **30 minutes**.
    - Discharge at 1C (13A) until voltage drops to **2.0V**.
    - Rest for **30 minutes**.
3. Stop when capacity / rated capacity < 0.8.
